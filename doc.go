Prerequisites

In order to use Voximplant SDK for the Go programming language, you need the following:

A developer account. If you don't have one, sign up here.
A private API key. There are 2 options to obtain it:
Either generate it in the Voximplant Control panel
Or call the CreateKey HTTP API method with the specified authentication parameters. You'll receive a response with the result field in it. Save the result value in a file (since we don't store the keys, save it securely on your side).

# Getting started

The best way to start is to use go get to add the SDK to your Go Workspace or application using Go modules:

	go get github.com/voximplant/apiclient-go

Without Go Modules (or in a GOPATH with Go 1.11 or 1.12), use go get with the /... suffix to retrieve all of the SDK's dependencies:

	go get github.com/voximplant/apiclient-go/...

# Example

This example shows how you can use the API client.

	package main

	import (
		"fmt"
		"github.com/voximplant/apiclient-go/config"
		"github.com/voximplant/apiclient-go/methods"
	)

	func main() {
		voxConfig := config.NewConfig().WithEndpoint("https://api.voximplant.com/platform_api/").WithKeyPath("vox_key_jwt.json")
		// Create a Voximplant client using the Config value
		client, err := methods.NewClient(voxConfig)
		if err != nil {
			panic("failed to create client, " + err.Error())
		}
		// Build input parameters
		params := methods.GetSubscriptionPriceParams{SubscriptionTemplateType:"SIP_REGISTRATION"}
		// Send the request and get the response or error back
		res, verr, err := client.Accounts.GetSubscriptionPrice(params)

		fmt.Println(res, verr, err)
	}
